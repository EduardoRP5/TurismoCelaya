They have several prizes displayed at the entrance.\nThe tables and chairs are folkloric, and by that I mean they have different artistic or historical scenes or characters on them, carved on the wood.  And they are comfortable.\nThe food is great, it's very rewarding to the palate and the presentation is attractive.\nThose were the good points, I mean, I would repeat my experience there if they assure me that they have improved the following:\nBad and slow service, it seems like the waiters don't really want to work there, I mean a soda took almost 15 min to arrive, and only after we reminded him about it.  The food also took ages to arrive, more than expected in a normal restaurant.  Plus we had to change the order one time because after all the time the waiter came back to say that they didn't have the ingredients.  What they were doing all this time? Who knows!\nLot of flies, you would expect flies on the street cars, but in  the restaurant? What about electric zappers, or any other kind of devices to make your stay better.\nI left a written review noticing these points so maybe they would improve, I hope because the food is pretty good, that what save it form 1 star.",
