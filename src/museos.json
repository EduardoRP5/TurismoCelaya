Eduardo Tresguerras, those are the parts that remain fixed in the museum, but there are also a few rooms of the museum in which the paintings on display change from time to time and They put paintings by different authors, equally beautiful, you can go alone or in a group and you can ask to be guided so that the paintings can be explained to you.",
