Eduardo Tresguerras, those are the parts that remain fixed in the museum, but there are also a few rooms of the museum in which the paintings on display change from time to time and They put paintings by different authors, equally beautiful, you can go alone or in a group and you can ask to be guided so that the paintings can be explained to you.",

They have several prizes displayed at the entrance.\nThe tables and chairs are folkloric, and by that I mean they have different artistic or historical scenes or characters on them, carved on the wood.  And they are comfortable.\nThe food is great, it's very rewarding to the palate and the presentation is attractive.\nThose were the good points, I mean, I would repeat my experience there if they assure me that they have improved the following:\nBad and slow service, it seems like the waiters don't really want to work there, I mean a soda took almost 15 min to arrive, and only after we reminded him about it.  The food also took ages to arrive, more than expected in a normal restaurant.  Plus we had to change the order one time because after all the time the waiter came back to say that they didn't have the ingredients.  What they were doing all this time? Who knows!\nLot of flies, you would expect flies on the street cars, but in  the restaurant? What about electric zappers, or any other kind of devices to make your stay better.\nI left a written review noticing these points so maybe they would improve, I hope because the food is pretty good, that what save it form 1 star.",

The service is consistently pleasant, and the rooms consistently well-groomed. Each room is equipped with a flat panel tv, stocked with 2 bottles of purified water, coffees and teas, and when you need more, there is a purified water dispenser by the elevator. For those longer term stays, there is a mini fridge, a medium size safe in the closet for valuables, and an option for a sofa bed, if you are spoiled like me and spend a lot of time in the room, since I have a driver that takes me to my meetings, meals, and wherever else I care to venture. That said, while there are stores and restaurants nearby, I can't speak to the safety of the area, because I have never wandered alone. Recently they have upgragded their toiletries to Yukatan Herbal, which doesn't leave your hair and skin so dry that it looks like you bathed in sand storm in the Sahara. I didn't even use my own toiletries this time, that I always carry with me to hotels. Complimentary breakfast is delicious, with an assortment of pastries, fresh fruits, fresh squeezed juices, and a made to order omlet stand (yes, with real, fresh cracked eggs, not the imitation, plastic/Styrofoam feeling fluff). It really puts American continental breakfast to shame. This is my go to place for every visit I make to Celaya.",

A few restaurants are placed inside as well as different stores and a building that I was told has offices inside\nAfter a workday I decided to have dinner in one of those restaurants closed to the Hotel that I could walk to and after dinner decided to have a walk inside to commercial zone.\nAs I was walking in the commercial area and walk in front of the 2nd building (with offices) I noticed there was a person staring at me front the lobby. I continue walking in the commercial zone which is probably about 250-meter length and has 2 lanes for cars (one going on each way). As continue walking there was this person that approached me and asked me if he could help me. I answered in which way he could help me? He asked me what I was doing in that place and answer that if there was a problem. He stated that the zone I was walking was a private area, and I should not be walking in the zone. Inside of the commercial area there are a lot of different business and parking lots. I mentioned that the zone I was walking was only in the parking zone, and he stated that was private.\nThis person started acting rude and increasing the level of his voice; he wanted me to go away from that area and do not approach the 2nd building or walk in front of it. He threatened me not to walk next to it or else.\nAt some point I was concern of this guys that he may pulled out a gun on me; fortunately, he did not. I disengage and continue walking.\nI end up my walking and call front desk to explain what happened during that night.\nI also was able to talk to the manager next day in the morning to explain. She did mention that the area I was walking is OK for hotel guests and mentioned she will talk to the responsible\nIf that is a restricted area there should be signs that warns people, also this should have been addressed by the hotel.\nI am concern that more people can go through the same and been threatened by this guy or have worst consequences. Perhaps more people have had this confrontation and have not complain about it.\nI hope the hotel does something about it; I trust they will.",

Our mistake was trusting that it would be there. We got back and the beds were made but that was about it that was done. We put all our stuff in the closet that we didn’t want touched with the exception of the digital watch that was left on the bed to put on on our way out but forgot. The manager insinuated that we lost it and blamed it on the staff bc she stated they get checked on the way out. The manager also confirmed they are not responsible for any items left outside the safety box in your room. However a smart watch can always be hidden in private area that are not check. With a pat down it would be unnoticed. This would not be a place I would stay again for my travels. I normally stay at the doubletree by Hilton down the street but decided to change it up and definitely regret it. We even checkout early and requested no room cleaning because of this issue.",
