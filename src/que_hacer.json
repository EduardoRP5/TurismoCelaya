I asked the waiter to change it for one that wasn't spicy...\n\n(Before I continue I want to point out that he was a male in his late 40s and didn't seem to be in a good mood, his costumer service was terrible, we asked questions about the menu and the food and his answers were short and irritated.)\n\nHe refused to change the order, saying that I should have told him when I ordered, I tried to explain to him that it made no sense to me, because the menu didn't say it was spicy.\n\nEventually another waiter pulled up and I asked to speak to their supervisor,she said it was her & seemed more hospitable, she also told me I should of told them I didn't want it spicy from the beginning, I reiterated what I had told her coworker and shortly after, she accepted to bring me a cocktail they wasn't spicy.",

For me, it is very disconcerting that after validating my documents and giving me the money, he tells me that I have to wait 24 hours. In the worst case scenario, I am imagining that he cannot give me that amount of money because he has not yet notified his fellow thieves and they take that amount from me leaving the branch. I had to go to Santander to carry out the same operation and they were actually able to give me the amount of evidence I needed, in addition to that I also went to the CPM sofipo and they can also give me a large amount of money.

They supposedly fixed it but said they couldn't try it there because the moded would register that spot as the adress so I took it home and by the time I connected the modem it turned on but now a message appeared on the screen saying the modem is not compatible with the Sim card to change it to a compatible Modem. Now I have to travel again for almost 2 hours to get to my closest Telcel, really not happy about this specially since I haven't been ae to use more than 70% of my megabytes and I still have to pay the full month.",
